Explanation:

www.foobar.com (HTTPS):

The website is accessible over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication between the server and the client, providing security and privacy.
Load Balancer (SSL Termination):

The load balancer terminates SSL connections, decrypts the traffic, and forwards it to the appropriate server. This setup offloads SSL encryption/decryption from individual servers, improving performance and simplifying certificate management.
Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx serves as the web server responsible for handling incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests, serving static content, and forwarding dynamic requests to the application server.
Application Server:

The application server executes application code, generates dynamic content, and communicates with the database server to retrieve and store data.
Database Server (MySQL):

MySQL serves as the database server, storing and managing website data. It accepts write requests from the application server and provides read access as needed.
Firewalls:

Each server is protected by a firewall to control incoming and outgoing traffic, ensuring network security and preventing unauthorized access.
Monitoring Clients:

Monitoring clients installed on each server collect data on system performance, resource utilization, and application health. This data is sent to a monitoring tool for analysis and visualization.
Specifics:

Firewalls: Firewalls are added to control network traffic and protect servers from unauthorized access or malicious attacks.
HTTPS Traffic: Serving traffic over HTTPS ensures data encryption, preventing eavesdropping and data tampering during transmission.
Monitoring: Monitoring is used to track the health and performance of servers, applications, and infrastructure components, enabling proactive management and troubleshooting.
Data Collection: The monitoring tool collects data from monitoring clients installed on servers via agents or APIs, aggregating metrics and logs for analysis.
Monitoring Web Server QPS: To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), you can set up monitoring tools to track incoming HTTP requests or use server-side metrics to monitor application performance.
Issues:

Terminating SSL at the Load Balancer Level:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer can expose decrypted traffic within the internal network, potentially compromising data security if the network is breached.
Single MySQL Server Capable of Accepting Writes:

Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes introduces a single point of failure and scalability limitations. It can lead to downtime and performance issues during high traffic or server failures.
Uniform Servers with Same Components:

Uniformity in server components increases the risk of a single vulnerability affecting all servers simultaneously. Diversifying server configurations can mitigate this risk and improve resilience against failures.
